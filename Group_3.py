    ---------------------------------------
    
    --- Requirements ---
    
    4 Questions from one of the GMetric's Domains
    Each Question is to be multiple choice with 4 answers.
    Code needs to be adaptable, so it can be added to the other groups code in time to create the full App/Game
    
    --- Ideas ---
    
    Use of functions, wrap our code in 1 callable function?
    Use a list and or dictionaries to store the Questions and their choices.
    Utilise If statements to control the flow of question to question and if right or wrong.
