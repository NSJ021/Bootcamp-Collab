# Bootcamp-Collab
Solid
Firebrand Bootcamp, Collab Project, Group 3

Quiz Application based on the Python Learning Domains.

Learning Domains

1. Operations Using Data Types and Operators
2. Flow Control with decisions and loops
3. Inputs and output Operations
4. Code Documentation and Structure
5. Troubleshooting and error handling
6. Operations using modules and tools

Multiple sections from various groups will be added to create a more complete Quiz app/game.

Each group will pick a module, currently 1-3, and develop 4 multiple-choice questions based on the chosen learning module.

The code should be clean and easy to merge with the other groups when the time comes, the general premise is for each group to have its set of questions and answers in their own function.
Which should allow for easier consolidation of the code when required.
