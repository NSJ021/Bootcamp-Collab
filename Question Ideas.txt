Question Ideas from Module 3

Question 1, based on opening a file in Python

Which code snippet is correct, for opening myFile.txt?\nAnswer with A, B, C, or D
A: fileToOpen = open('myFile.txt', 'r'),
B: fileToOpen = open('my_File.txt', 'r'),
C: fileToOpen = open('myFile.txt', 'w'),
D: fileToOpen = open('myFile.txt', 'X')

Question 1 Summary / Details after an answer is given

A": When opening a file, you are required to use the open() function.
    This function takes two parameters.
    1. The file itself, e.g. myFile.txt.
    2. "r" for reading the file, "a" for appending the file, "w" for writing to the file, and "x" for creating a file.

B": A: fileToOpen = open('myFile.txt', 'r') is the correct answer.
    B: fileToOpen = open('my_File.txt', 'r') is incorrect because the file name parameters are incorrect.

C": A: fileToOpen = open('myFile.txt', 'r') is the correct answer.
    C: fileToOpen = open('myFile.txt', 'w') is incorrect because the second parameter is incorrect as it is set to write not read "w".

D": A: fileToOpen = open('myFile.txt', 'r') is the correct answer.
    D: fileToOpen = open('myFile.txt', ' ') is incorrect because the second parameter is incorrect as it is set to create a file with "x" not read.
